    <h1>Services We Offer</h1>
    <p class="para">Henna services typically involve applying henna paste to the skin, letting it dry, and then scraping it off. This procedure leaves behind a temporary stain that, depending on the type of henna used, where it is applied on the body, and how well it is cared for, can last anywhere from a few days to a few weeks.</p>
